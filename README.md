# About the game
"The Road" is a text-based RPG formatted for Windows, built using Python and Tkinter

There are two modes:
*  **Quick play**: The best option to test out the games features and understand how it works. You'll be provided with a preset inventory so you can immediately shop for different gear, gamble in the casino, or fight enemies in the pits
*  **Story mode**: Starting with minimal gear, you'll slowly discover your characters mission as the game progresses. Often, you'll have to make choices that will directly impact you and the story ahead

# How to play
The easiest way to play is by downloading the game as an executable by following this link: https://github.com/CoachhCal/The-Road/releases/tag/v0.1 

If you choose to download the source code, you will need Python and Pillow to run it. Below are the versions installed on my computer.
* Python 3.12.0
* Pillow 10.4.0 -> "pip install pillow"

# Extra information
This game was originally created as a console application to practice Python, before deciding to add a GUI and turn it into a small personal project.


The game takes values from the various csv files, so you can easily change things in the game by editing said files, such as the enemies attacks, damage, weapon costs, etc.


The game was built in a Windows environment. Unfortunately, the formatting with Tkinter is messed up when trying to run it on Mac.


To view the entire application, you'll need a screen size of at least 1100x800 px
